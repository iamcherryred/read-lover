			<h1>A letter to my Lover</h1>
			<p >My dearest baby love,</p>
			<p>Upon writing this letter, I didn't really know what to say or how should I convince you in 29 million ways that my love for you will lasts forever- that it has no end. It just keeps growing, baby. I hope this simple gesture helps you remember how corny and cringe I am as a person hahaha. Kidding aside, I just hope that this simple surprise helps you remember the person you fell in love with. Don't stop loving her because you are the best thing that's ever been hers. I still can't believe that I can call you mine.</p>
			<p>I don't know if you've noticed but when I'm with you I just feel so safe. I can laugh as loud as I can or cry as hard as I could with you not judging me. I am so grateful for the way you challenge me to grow, to immerse myself with new experiences, and to go outside my comfort zone. Your unwavering belief in me gives me strength, and your love has become one of the foundation upon which I build my dreams.</p>
			<p>When you told me you love me less because I returned the ring, it felt like my heartbeat stopped. I really wish I could turn back time, but I know what happened in the past cannot be undone. I swear to God, I won't make you feel that way again. I can never forgive myself if I ever hurt you again.</p>
			<p>If you didn't know, my life with you is everything that I never knew I wanted. I remember I used to say that I will never fall in love because I don't want any distractions and I have different priorities, but the truth is I'm just scared. I'm scared to give and to love. And maybe I'm also afraid that being alone is just my reality because I thought back then that no one will ever want to be with me, let alone notice me. But you came along and just made everything seem so easy.</p>
			<p>You saw me.</p>
			<p>You chose to be with me.</p>
			<p>You love me.</p>
			<p>I felt your genuine love. I felt your sincerity. In you, I found my soulmate, my first true love, and my home. I promise to keep loving you and to support you in all that you do, and to be by your side through every twist and turn that life may bring. Thank you for being the light that brightens my world and for loving me unconditionally. I want to keep falling for you, baby. You are the most precious gift papa God has bestowed upon me, and I will forever hold you in the depths of my heart.</p>
			<p>Cheers to more memories, more laughs, and more songs I will sing and write for you.</p>
			<p>Always, with all my love,</p>
